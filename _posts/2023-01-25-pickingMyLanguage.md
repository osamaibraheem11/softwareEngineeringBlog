The language I am choosing to study and learn this semester is PHP (https://www.php.net). PHP is a server-side language used for web development. There is a common assumption that PHP is old and no longer being used, according to this site (https://kinsta.com/php-market-share/) 79.2% of websites are built using PHP. Here are just a few sites that use PHP, Facebook (Meta), Wikipedia, Slack, MailChimp and WordPress. WordPress is the most popular CMS (content management system) on the market, it powers about 40% of all websites.

Another reason I am excited to learn PHP is because the company that I work for has some legacy software that was built using PHP. It will be nice to be able to jump in and make updates to the software.
