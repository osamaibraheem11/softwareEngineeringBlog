At first, I wanted to focus on the language syntax of PHP. I looked up some online tutorials and stumbled upon Codecademy's Learn PHP course (https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-php) I figured it would be a good place to start.

I first learned how to embed PHP into HTML which was interesting to see. The way it's done is simply adding tags into HTML and your PHP code will be executed by the server! This means that you are able to add PHP to your website in small chunks rather than having to rewrite the whole system.

Another thing I learned is that every PHP line will need a semicolon ";" this was hard getting used to when I was practicing because I am used to having languages that do not require that.

The next thing I learned was printing "hello world!", echo is the keyword for printing in PHP. Printing hello world is as simple as echo "hello world!";. Following up on the course started looking at variables and strings. I learned how to assign/create variables, using the key character "$" followed by the variable name for example $favorite_language = "PHP". $favorite_language is the variable and is assigned the value PHP.

Following up I learned about doing string concatenation, which simply is done by adding a "." between two different strings. For example "hello world" can be written as echo "hello " . "world".

The course then moved into PHP and numbers, this was pretty much straightforward. It is very similar to other languages I have worked with!

Finally, the last thing I learned so far was about PHP functions. Creating a function starts with the keyword "function" followed by your function name. Pretty straightforward compared to other languages!

All the code I created can be found here https://github.com/osamaibraheem11/softwareEngineeringBlog/blob/main/codeExamples/startingOut.php. Now that I have learned the syntax, I plan on moving on to running PHP files on my system and reading and writing files!
