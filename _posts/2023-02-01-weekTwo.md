This week I wanted to focus on getting input, reading files, and writing/reading from databases.

I found the official PHP documentation to be extremely helpful!

I found this article on taking input from a user (https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.readline). In my code example, I am asking the user for the file name that they would like to be read. The article shows how to handle the case if the file does not exist. The function fopen which opens a gateway to the file (like a stream of data) returns False if the file does not exist. I wrote an if statement to check if the function is false and if it is I write out that the file does not exist.

Moving along, I wanted to work with CSV files to start with as that is a typical file that is uploaded into a database. I found an article on a function called fgetcsv (https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.fgetcsv). This function creates a pointer to the data stream and parers the file if it's a CSV file. The function returns each row assigned to a variable.

I then started looking for ways to connect to a MySQL database. I found another article on this built-in class included in the PHP package. It's called mysqli (https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.mysqli).

Using this class object was enjoyable. It is very simple to initialize an instance of the class and connect it to a database. Using that class I wrote all the rows to the database from the file using a function a wrote called writeRowToDatabase($tableName,$data). This takes in a table name and a row of data. I also wrote another function called getRowsFromDatabase($tableName), which returns all rows from the table passed in.

A small problem I ran into is variable scope. I found another article that describes the variable scope in PHP.(https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.scope.php) I am used to programming in languages where variables assigned outside of the function are global and can be accessed within the function. When I ran my code, I would get an error that the variable $mySQL can not be assigned. I did some digging and found out about a keyword called global. This keyword can be used to add to a variable name within the function and it will allow the function to access it. For example, I added global $mySQL; inside my functions and it worked!

My next goal is to work on separating my code into different files and writing wrappers around them. Building a small terminal program that takes inputs from a user and writes/reads to the database but is spread out over multiple files.

All the code I created can be found here https://github.com/osamaibraheem11/softwareEngineeringBlog/blob/main/codeExamples/weekTwo.php.
