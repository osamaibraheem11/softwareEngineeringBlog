This week I wanted to work with PHP embedded in HTML files. Since PHP is a server-side language, I will need a local server to serve my PHP files.

I did a simple google search "How to run a PHP server on a mac?" I found this article at (https://www.mytecbits.com/apple/macos/launch-a-php-website). As long as I have PHP installed on my system, then I just need to run "php -S localhost:9000".

I built my directory in codeExamples/weekFour. I have three files in there, index.php (Homepage), form.php (Simple form to take in an image URL), and submitUrl.php (This page does the work of writing the given URL to the database).

index.php gets current images from my local database and adds them to an array. I found out how to push items into an array using the PHP docs (https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.array-push) since I have not done that yet, Currently, I just have a simple image HTML element that shows the image with a fixed width and height. I used this article to figure out how to embed PHP in HTML files (https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-use-php-in-html-code--cms-34378)

form.php has a simple HTML form that takes in a put from the user and sends it to submitUrl.php via POST method. The difference between POST vs GET is that the data is encrypted when sent via POST.

submitUrl.php get the imgUrl using this line of code "$\_POST['imgUrl'];" I used this article to figure out how to access the data coming from the form (https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.post.php) It then takes that URL and writes to the database, once that is done the page will wait for 5 seconds and send the user back to the index page (showing the newest image that was added)
