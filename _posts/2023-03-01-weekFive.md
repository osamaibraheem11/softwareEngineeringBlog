This week I spent some time working on getting a better understanding of how the file structure works in PHP. This is where I found this great article (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-include-content-of-a-php-file-into-another-php-file/) that showed how importing other PHP functions from other files worked. The keyword here is "include", which the PHP documentation does a great job of explaining (https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.include.php). The include expression includes and evaluates the specified file. The example I wrote was that I had a db.php file, this file played the role of my database connection. This was important for me as I build bigger projects, there needed to be one true source for my database connection. If my database connection information changed, I could change it in one place rather than all the files.

The next thing I did was looked up how to expose a rest API in PHP. I found this great article (https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/03/08/simple-rest-api-php) I used this as a starting reference to being with and plan on implementing the full tutorial next week. A keyword I learned is "header", header() is used to send a raw HTTP header. This allows me to set any headers I want in my API response, in my example I sent header("Content-Type:application/json"), to let the user know that they are getting a JSON object back.

I plan on building upon this application next week, currently, I have an API that fetches orders by id and returns them in a JSON object using a restful GET API.
